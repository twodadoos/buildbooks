## build-books

This repository includes a set of miniature build books for installing applications, tools, and single-purpose environments. Books include reproducible steps, configuration options, and notes to help achieve a successful deployment.

**_Disclaimer_**

These build books are shared for informational purposes and reflect only one possible approach based on specific assumptions, environments, and versions at a single point in time. If anything documented here appears unclear, questionable, or unsuitable for your situation, stop now and proceed no further. You are expected to use your own professional judgement when determining whether you have the appropriate experience, resources, capacity, and safeguards to follow any instructions contained herein.

It is assumed you will backup all relevant data and systems before beginning, and that you will follow all industry best practices to protect data, infrastructure, and credentials. Software versions, platforms, dependencies, and environmental differences may cause outcomes to vary; thus, it is possible to follow these instructions perfectly and still encounter failures or unexpected behavior. You are solely responsible for validating results, testing changes, and ensuring suitability for your environment.

Nothing in this repository is intended to replace, override, supersede, or conflict with any official documentation from software authors, vendors, manufacturers, or service providers. In the event of any discrepancy, then any official documentation is the authoritative source of truth. Any costs incurred, including infrastructure, licensing, cloud usage, or related expenses, are your responsibility.
