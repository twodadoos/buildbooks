# Install local Kubernetes Cluster 

## Environment:
* Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
* libvirt 8.0.0
* QEMU 6.2.0

## Prerequisites:
* Fully provisioned and updated hosts
* Linux host root access
* Internet access

### Assumptions and preamble

While this approach is valid for cloud deployments (e.g. onto EC2 instances in AWS), it's also one that's been  tested and refined within a local libvirt environment; thus, it's assumed that's how you might try it first, in hope it'll be easier to succeed again, elsewhere, sooner.

An even faster way forward is to utilize [this Bash script](provision-k8s-nodes-ubuntu.sh)
for all installation operations, up to the very first Control Plane and Worker node configuration requirements on each target host.

This micro build book draws primarily from the commands and operations in that script, plus offers more guidance by sharing next steps for completing the installation, such that the final result ought to be a new,  operational Kubernetes cluster.
